### 🚀 Technologies & Learning

This project was a great opportunity to practice and learn several core web development concepts:

-   **HTML5 Structure**: 🏗️ I used semantic HTML5 tags to build a well-organized and accessible page structure.
-   **CSS Styling**: 🖌️ I applied custom CSS to create the unique layout and design. I gained experience in using flexbox for alignment and layout, and `position: absolute` for precise element placement.
-   **CSS Custom Properties**: I utilized CSS custom properties (variables) to maintain a consistent color palette across the site.
-   **Responsive Design**: 📱 I implemented media queries to ensure the website is fully responsive and provides an optimal viewing experience on all devices, especially mobile.
-   **Google Fonts**: 🔡 I incorporated custom fonts ("Quicksand" and "Raleway") from Google Fonts to enhance the typography and visual appeal.
-   **Animations**: I created simple but effective CSS animations, such as the marquee text and animated slide buttons, to add dynamic and engaging elements to the page.
-   **User Interface (UI) Design**: This project helped me practice creating a clean and intuitive user interface with clear calls-to-action and visually distinct sections.
